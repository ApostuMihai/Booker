Your database should have at least three main entities: Users, Books, and a junction table that I'll call UserBooks to handle the many-to-many relationship between users and books, along with the state of each book for each user.
Users Table

    UserID (Primary Key)
    Username
    Email
    Additional user-related fields as required.

Books Table

    BookID (Primary Key)
    Title
    Author
    ISBN
    Other relevant book details (e.g., publication date, genre).

UserBooks Table

    UserBookID (Primary Key)
    UserID (Foreign Key)
    BookID (Foreign Key)
    State (Enum with values 'unread', 'in progress', 'read')
    Additional fields if needed, such as StartDate, EndDate.
