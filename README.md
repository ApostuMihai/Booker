# Booker
 
An ASP.NET Core project that is in progress. So far the plan is to create a small web application that will let users review books, add them to their profile and asign different statuses to them (unread, in progress and done). Users can also leave reviews for a book after reading it.

On the book's page you can find the title, author, genre, reviews and a few other details such as links to other websites where you can buy said book from.

The frontend will be most likely made with Angular. I will provide an in-depth tutorial on how to build & use this project locally after finishing it.
